          <h2>Why the North Norfolk Coast?</h2>
          <h3>Norfolk, There's something for everyone</h3>
          <p>
            Situated on the east coast of England, North Norfolk has 45 miles of
            stunning coastline, Blue Flag beaches, the unique Deep History Coast
            and breath-taking countryside. North Norfolk, home to the Deep
            History Coast, has a unique coastline of unspoilt, award-winning
            beaches. Head inland to the countryside with its rich agricultural
            roots and discover market towns and villages, home to eateries
            serving locally sourced seasonal dishes, shops and artisans. There
            are museums, stately homes and places of cultural and historical
            interest to explore. Set in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty,
            The Broads National Park and nature reserves of international
            importance, north Norfolk is a haven for wildlife and birds, and
            great for walking. As Norfolk is the driest county in the UK, it's
            perfect to visit all year round.
