          <h2>Why the North Norfolk Coast?</h2>
          <h3>Norfolk, There's something for everyone</h3>
          <p>
            Situated on the east coast of England, North Norfolk has 45 miles of
            stunning coastline, Blue Flag beaches, the unique Deep History Coast
            and breath-taking countryside. North Norfolk, home to the Deep
            History Coast, has a unique coastline of unspoilt, award-winning
            beaches. Head inland to the countryside with its rich agricultural
            roots and discover market towns and villages, home to eateries
            serving locally sourced seasonal dishes, shops and artisans. There
            are museums, stately homes and places of cultural and historical
            interest to explore. Set in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty,
            The Broads National Park and nature reserves of international
            importance, north Norfolk is a haven for wildlife and birds, and
            great for walking. As Norfolk is the driest county in the UK, it's
            perfect to visit all year round.

                We love popping in for a beer in this wonderful beer garden.
                They always have a great selection of local beers on tap and the
                service is always frinedly. Great for a bite to eat as well!

                A relaxed and quirky fresh seafood restaurant serving crabs and
                lobsters along with other tasty dishes. Rocky Bottoms started
                out as an 1800s brick kiln with a purpose to fire bricks. The
                seafood is caught fresh daily by Richard and prepared and served
                by the rest of the family.

                An incredible spot to enjoy a beer and the freshest seafood
